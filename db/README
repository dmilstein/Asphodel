Scripts for setting up / tearing down MySQL database for the Asphodel game.

All scripts are expected to run within a database named 'Asphodel'.

Three key, overall scripts are:

 - create_all.sql

Creates all the tables for the game, in proper order w/ foreign keys and the
like.  Does this by sourcing distinct sql files for each table (or
closely-linked set of tables).  

If you create new tables, create files for them in this directory and add
them to creatre_all.sql.


 - drop_all.sql

This drops all the tables created above, in proper order w/ respect to
foreign keys and the like (which, in general, is just the reverse order they
were created in).  Unlike create_all, this directly names the tables it
drops (for reasons of simplicity).

If you create new tables, add drop statements for them to drop_all.sql, in
proper order w/r/t foreign keys.


 - nuke_rebuild.sql

This just runs drop_all.sql followed by create_all.sql.  Obviously, use with
care.
