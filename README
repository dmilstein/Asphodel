Asphodel Notes
====================

Risks:
--------------------
* Can small bursts of gameplay be compelling?
* Can we communicate the game on a tiny phone screen?
* Is it different enough from other games?

Investigate Key Risks
Before we spend too much time and effort on an idea of the game, we're trying to identify the risky parts of our idea and reduce those risks until we have a good enough idea of what to build.
