* x Set up Tornado
** Try out pip (but no demo apps, then)
Okay, that worked to create a hello, world app, now what?

Interestingly, db is sync, here's why (from, I think, The Man @ FriendFeed):

We experimented with different async DB approaches, but settled on 
synchronous at FriendFeed because generally if our DB queries were 
backlogging our requests, our backends couldn't scale to the load 
anyway. Things that were slow enough were abstracted to separate 
backend services which we fetched asynchronously via the async HTTP 
module. 

I may open source the async MySQL client I wrote, but I am still 
skeptical of the long term value given the code complexity it 
introduces.
