Simplified Rules for First Round Playtesting
8/11/2011

Goal of the Game
================

Take over the galaxy by building up an empire and destroying the other
player.


At Start
========

The galaxy starts with a set of Planets, and both players can see the full
map (they have good astronomical teams).

Each player starts off by owning a single planet (and they know the location
of the other player's start planet).  The planets are not "close" (so that
each player has to build up something of an empire before they could
consider wiping out their opponent).


Star Lanes
==========

The most efficient way to move large ships between planets is by way of star
lanes (building of which involves creating complex jump point machinery at
each end).  Note: it *is* possible to move between star systems other ways,
see below.

Potential star lanes exist between some (but not all) pairs of planets.
Those potential paths only becomes visible when a player reaches a planet at
either end (with a scout or other ship).  Only the player who reaches the
planet can see the potential star lane (it's a closely held secret of the
imperial exploratory forces).  However, once built, everyone can see it
(it's impossible to keep secret at that point).

It costs 15 units to build a star lane.


Properties of Planets
=====================

A planet has: a population.  The population of a planet is fixed (varies
across planets, unknown at game start).

Planets produce tax revenue in proportion to two things:

 - Their population (0-10)

 - The log (base 2) of the number of other planets within their empire that
   they can reach by star lanes (the size of the connected-by-star-lanes
   component of their empire)

At start, two origin planets have a population of 8.  But all other planets
discovered have varying degrees of habitability.

The second one means that players have an incentive to connect large graphs
of planets up by starlanes, and that other players can severely reduce tax
revenue by taking over a key planet that forms a bridge between two
connected components of someone's empire graph (this feels like a nice model
of actual 19th century empires, where tiny islands in the middle of
nowehere, like Mauritius, became incredibly valuable and hard-fought,
because they sat astride major trade routes from Europe to the Orient).

(Alternately, we could tie it to, not just the # of planets in a component,
but the network diameter, which gives an incentive to build sprawling
empires, which are easier to disrupt, and I kind of like that tension, but
it may be hard for players to understand, without some cueing from the
interface.)


Technology
==========

There's a tech tree along 2 axes (with, for now, just points along each
axis, maybe later there's specific, named, targets)

 - Combat (ability for your ships to inflict damage on other ships +
   planets, and to sustain damage in return)

 - Range (how far your ships can travel in a single turn -- mostly along
   starlanes, but for some ship classes, outside as well)

Each player starts with a 1 for each.

Each turn, players can invest in trying to improve either kind of tech. But
the system is set up to strongly reward steady investment in tech over time,
rather than one big investment all at once.  This is done by making the
return on any single turn of investment exponentially decreasing as the size
of the invesment goes up.  If you spend N units in a turn, your tech
increases in proportion to log(N) (base 10).  In other words, spending 10
moves you up 1 unit, but it takes 100 to move you up 2, and 1000 to move you
up 3.  There is some randomness surrounding that, but that's the basic
proportions.


Ship Types
==========
There are four distinct types of ships (for all of the below, assume the
current combat tech for a player is C, and the current range tech is R).
All ships are built on your homeworld.

 - Scouts (cost 20 units)

These are fairly cheap, have no offense or defense, but can jump to planets
without using starlanes.  How far they can jump is determined by the range
tech axis.  They can also move very quickly along star lanes.

Movement outside of starlanes: R
Movement along starlanes: 2R
Combat max: 0


 - Colony Ships (cost 30 units)

These can only travel along starlanes, have basically no offense or defense,
but can colonize planets, taking ownership of them.

Movement outside of starlanes: 0
Movement along starlanes: R
Combat max: 0 


 - Frigates (cost 100 units)

These are expensive, have modest offense, modest defense, but are able to
move without using starlanes.  Like scouts, their distance is controlled by
range, but they can't move as far as scouts.

Movement outside of starlanes: R/3
Movement along starlanes: 1.5 * R
Combat max: C/3


 - Ships of the Line (cost 200 units)

These are expensive, can only move along star lanes, and have massively
powerful offense and defense.

Movement outside of starlanes: 0
Movement along starlanes: R
Combat max: C

Cost: 200

So players face a choice: build a highly mobile force of slightly weaker
ships, or a sluggish but devastating force.

For ships moving along star lanes, any two planets so connected are 1 unit
apart.  So, basically, you can move all ship types quickly (though not
instantly) within your empire graph.  And you can move specialized forces
outside of the graph, much more slowly.


Combat
======

If a player sends ships to a planet where the opponent has ships, a battle
ensues.  It plays out the following way (without any input from the player
once the battle has started).

Combat proceeds in rounds.  The defender goes first.

Each combat point represents a chance to do a point of damage to an opposing
ship.  You have a 50/50 chance of doing damage with each point.

Once a ship has sustained as many points of damage as its combat rating, it
is dead.  Until that point, it fights at full strength.

Damage is assigned to an opponent's smallest ships first.  Thus, if a single
large ship with 5 combat points faces 5 small ships with 1 combat point
apiece, the large ship will generally come out ahead, because it would
continue to fight at 5 every turn, even as the opposing ships were gradually
destroyed.


What Happens During Each Player's Turn
======================================

 - Review updates from action started during last turn

E.g. planets explored, star lanes completed, ships completed, tech
investments paying off, colonies established, revenue received.

Attacks by the opponent that took place.


 - Move your ships around, scouting, launching attacks, starting colonies

 - See battles play out

 - Decide how to invest your revenue

    - Tech R&D 

    - Building ships 

    - Building star lanes
